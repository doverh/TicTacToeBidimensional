Human-Computer Interface Description: The main interface consists of the traditional
tic-tac-toe board. To place an X or O, the user moves the mouse over the desired square and clicks. The system will then fill the square with the correct symbol for that player. Beneath the board, the system notifies the player when it is his or her turn. The interface also consists of opening screens that prompt the user for game information, such as whether this game will be played against the computer, ,and the symbols the players will use to represent X or O. At the end of the game, the system uses a dialog to notify the player(s) of the winner and ask the player(s) if they wish to play another game or exit the program.
